Your first C++ program, congratulations!

This is particularly for WINDOWS but the concepts still apply -
Begin by downloading a C++ compiler
Handy tutorial available here for setting up C++ for VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp
If you just want a good compiler go to https://www.msys2.org/ and follow the instructions there

After setting up your compiler, you're ready to start this program :)
